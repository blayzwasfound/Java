This repository is a personal collection of Java programs written according to the ICSE Computer Applications syllabus, covering everything from basic syntax and control structures to strings, arrays, classes, objects, and library classes. Each program is written with clarity in mind, keeping the logic simple and well-commented so that students can easily follow along, revise concepts, and prepare for exams. The aim is to make learning Java more approachable by providing practical examples that reflect real ICSE-style questions, allowing anyone to compile and run them in an IDE like BlueJ, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse, or directly through the terminal. All code here is free to use and modify for educational purposes, and contributions to improve or expand the collection are always welcome.
